Usability Heuristics
========

Objective: Choose two usability heuristics or inclusive design principle to change for your site.

Heuristic Two - Match between system and real world
-------

To better match what Ravelry does and the organic nature of how I personally select projects, I'd like to add a "tags" column to my project table.  This will allow me to create and update projects with searchable tags, such as the name of who it is for, if it uses a certain technique, or if it the patttern is designed by previously liked pattern writer.  I often add things to my Ravely "queue" based on designers such as Jared Flood and Brenda Dayne, or for the person I think would like that item.  Being able to add this to my project will align it a bit more to how I plan my projects.

Heuristic Seven - Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
-------

If possible, I'd like to add a dark mode to my project.  As the main user, I prefer dark mode screens because they are less likely to trigger migraines or eye strain.  A quick look at Ravelry's website shows that they do have a dark mode, so it may be possible to use their API to apply to my own site.

Typography
--------

I've chosen to use OpenDyslexic, and to use it for everything on my website.  While I don't have dyslexia, I like the OpenDyslexic font and feel like it is easier for me to read when I'm tired or distracted.  The font was designed to prevent things like text swimming and flipping, and where each symbol is weighted is based on what is most likely to prevent a dyslexic (or any other flavor of nuerodivergence) from making transctiption errors while we read.

Color Scheme
---------

I've chosen to use a monochromatic purple color scheme.  I like purple and consider it to be The Best Color, and this site is being made for me, so I might as well pick my favorite color to be everywhere!  Also, because this will mostly be for gifts I'm making for other people, purple is the color they are least likely to be, and any images I upload will contrast nicely.
