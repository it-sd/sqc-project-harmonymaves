Development Context
-----------------
This app was developed mostly independently, beginning as a final project that was 
meant to use a database connection.  Dexter was the student who collaborated with me
most, also this was more to practice our use of GIT rather than coding for each other.

I tried to use render in this project and did not understand it well.  I learned more
about APIs, and got lots of practice with GIT and discord.  The database connection
aspect of the assignment was dropped early, so while I've done this for other classes,
this is an area I still need practice in.  I also learned unit testing with Jasmine and 
writing in Express and EJS.


What Went Well
--------------
The early stages of development went very well.  I feel very comfortable with website
sketching, developing sample pages, research, and basic schemas.  The concepts behind
unit testing makes a lot of sense.  I also felt very comfortable with GIT and while I 
did not use it extensively for version control, I feel that I could do so in another
project with more people touching multiple files.

I've had lots of practice with the first steps of website development, and learning
to use Markdown to document and track development documents was very useful.  Having one
location that 'travels' with the project is something I plan to continue doing with my
own development.

While I was happy to see the database requirement be lifted from the project because I
don't have much enjoyment from database development and management, I felt that I was
able to complete the beginning steps easily.

Learning to draft releases and pull requests for GIT seemed very relevant and therefore
I felt very comfortable with GIT fairly quickly.  I had used it before in another setting
that was more confusing, and this helped me see GIT in the way it can be used, rather than
as an annoying extra thing to do.

What Could Have Gone Better
---------------------
The course as written was too much for a 3 credit course, and while our instructor did
his very best to limit confusion, it was a very confusing project with changing goals.
This is probably much like a live project in a production setting, but as a person who
very much enjoys trudging to her little goal... I did not enjoy that aspect.  I wish I
had been able to get a better, more clear understanding of the project from the beginning, 
but I also realize I will almost never have that in the real world either- real life 
projects are also always in flux.

Because the project was in flux, it was harder to connect what I was making to the goals
of the class.  I never finished my database, and at the last minute changed what my website
does so that I would have something to create and turn in.  I feel like I didn't get as much
practice and direction on testing as I would have liked.

Conclusion
----------
I understood very little at several times throughout this project.  But I think that this 
is more about the class having only been written within the last year and only taught twice.
I do wish that CVTC (and every other secondary education institution) would realize that
writing curriculum is a skill that needs to be taught, learned, and practiced.  Most of the
issues I saw would never have come up if the writer of the course has been given training on
how to write curriculum or access to a curriculum writer to collaborate with.  I know it's
possible, CVTC has an education department. It was very, very frustrating to be someone that
knows how to write curriculum and learning materials during this course.
