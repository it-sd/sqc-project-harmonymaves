Development Context
-----------------
This app was developed mostly independently, beginning as a final project that was 
meant to use a database connection.  Dexter was the student who collaborated with me
most, also this was more to practice our use of GIT rather than coding for each other.

I tried to use render in this project and did not understand it well.  I learned more
about APIs, and got lots of practice with GIT and discord.  The database connection
aspect of the assignment was dropped early, so while I've done this for other classes,
this is an area I still need practice in.  I also learned unit testing with Jasmine and 
writing in Express and EJS.


What Went Well
--------------
The early stages of development went very well.  I feel very comfortable with website
sketching, developing sample pages, research, and basic schemas.  The concepts behind
unit testing makes a lot of sense.  I also felt very comfortable with GIT and while I 
did not use it extensively for version control, I feel that I could do so in another
project with more people touching multiple files.

What Could Have Gone Better
---------------------
The course as written was too much for a 3 credit course, and while our instructor did
his very best to limit confusion, it was a very confusing project with changing goals.
This is probably much like a live project in a production setting, but as a person who
very much enjoys trudging to her little goal... I did not enjoy that aspect.  I wish I
had been able to get a better, more clear understanding of the project from the beginning, 
but I also realize I will almost never have that in the real world either- real life 
projects are also always in flux.
